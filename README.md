# Hello World Module for Joomla!

This is a ready to go Joomla module template that you can use to build your own modules. I have added all the settings, elements and things I could find.

## What does it do?
This is a module that replaces displays a language sensitive Hello World statement. You set the langauge in the module

## How to use the plugin
- Install the module.
- Configure the module how you want it, including making sure it is published and display on a page of your choosing.
- Load the page that has the module configured to load on it.
- You will not see a Hello World message displayed in your chosen language.

## NOTES
- The title for the module when install used is en-GB.mod_qwrealurl.sys.ini MOD_QWREALURL_NAME="QWRealUrl"
- The module name ($module->name) is made from the mod_qwrealurl.php <filename module="mod_qwrealurl">mod_qwrealurl.php</filename>
